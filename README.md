# ZolphScape

## Project Description
This is the code base for ZolphScape which is a platform to allow for developers and researchers to showcase their work. Here at ZolphScape we hope to create an environment where information no longer feels overwhelming by allowing users to not just share and showcase their work but also allowing users to pick and choose what exact information they wish to see on a day-to-day basis. The goal of ZolphScape is to give something back to the community which is why currently the code base is public for learning. However please do not use any images or videos from ZolphScape unless you have specific permission. All Content on ZolphScape is still the property of ZolphScape but anyone is free to expand and morph our codebase into their own projects and ideas. Serious Collaborations are welcome and encouraged. Please feel free to reach out to Zolphite on LinkedIn for more information.

### WARNING

Please give some credit if this codebase was helpful or made a contribute to your project in a large way.
